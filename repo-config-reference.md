# repo.config Reference

This file defines validation scope, required structure, and allowed workflow states.

## File Location

- `.agents/workflows/workflow-contract/repo.config.json`

## Bootstrap Mode

Use:

`make -C .agents/workflows/workflow-contract init`

Script fallback:

`python3 .agents/workflows/workflow-contract/scripts/init_workflow_contract.py`

Bootstrap mode creates missing required directories/files from this config before validation. This is what prevents first-run `STRUCTURE` failures in new repos.

## Top-Level Keys

- `version` (required): config schema version.
- `repo` (required): repo metadata (`name`, `docs_root`).
- `paths` (required): canonical doc paths used by validators.
- `read_order` (required): layer reading sequence.
- `required_directories` (required): directories that must exist.
- `required_files` (required): files that must exist.
- `disallowed_directories` (optional): directories that must not exist.
- `disallowed_files` (optional): files that must not exist.
- `legacy_reference_patterns` (optional): forbidden path patterns scanned across text/code files.
- `validation` (required): validator toggles.
- `statuses` (required): allowed statuses by artifact type.
- `transitions` (optional): allowed status transitions.
- `exceptions` (optional): exception-policy requirements.

## Required vs Optional

Required in practice for reliable enforcement:

- `repo`
- `paths`
- `read_order`
- `required_directories`
- `required_files`
- `validation`
- `statuses`

Optional but recommended:

- `disallowed_directories`
- `disallowed_files`
- `legacy_reference_patterns`
- `transitions`
- `exceptions`

## Safe Defaults

- Keep `paths` rooted under `docs/`.
- Keep `validation.enable_metadata`, `enable_transitions`, and `enable_references` as `true`.
- Start proposal statuses with: `proposed`, `under-review`, `on-hold`.
- Keep `read_order` aligned to layering policy:
  - `docs/design`
  - `docs/implementation`
  - `docs/changes/wayfinding`
  - `docs/changes/proposed`

## Common Mistakes

- Path mismatch between `paths` and actual repo tree.
- Adding status values in docs that are not listed under `statuses`.
- Updating templates but forgetting to update metadata checks.
- Allowing legacy references to old docs paths in markdown or code comments.
- Adding new workflow artifacts without deciding whether bootstrap should create them.
- Forgetting to add `Session Budget` when tightening task-readiness rules.
- Disabling validators to bypass documentation drift.

## Portability Notes

- Monorepo: keep one shared `docs/` tree unless teams explicitly need per-service docs roots.
- Single-service repo: keep same structure, even if some directories are lightly populated initially.
- Migration from existing docs: map existing truth to `design`, execution tracking to `implementation`, unresolved deltas to `changes/proposed` before enforcing strict disallowed references.
